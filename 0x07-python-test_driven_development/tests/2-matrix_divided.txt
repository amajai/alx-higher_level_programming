Divide each element in a matrix by a given divisor and return a new matrix.

This function takes a matrix, represented as a list of lists, and a divisor (an integer or a float).
Returns a new matrix where each element is the result of the division, rounded to two decimal places.

Arguments:
    matrix (list of lists): The input matrix, where each inner list represents a row of numeric values.
        All rows must have the same length, and the elements must be integers or floats.
    div (int or float): The divisor used for division.

Returns:
    list of lists: A new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
        Each element in the new matrix is the result of dividing the corresponding element in the input
        matrix by the divisor. The result is rounded to two decimal places.

Raises:
    TypeError: If 'matrix' is not a list of lists containing integers or floats, or if 'div' is not a number.
    ZeroDivisionError: If 'div' is zero.
